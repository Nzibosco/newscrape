# Welcome to Newscrape

## About Newscrape

Newscrape allows you to scrape latest news articles from the New York Times. 

## Premises 

The application scrapes articles from the New York Times and stores their links, summaries, and titles in a Mongo Database. 

The applicattion allows you to save and comment on articles, so you can remember your most important details. 

You can revisit saved articles or delete them. 

## Technology 

Newscrape is developped using the following languages and technologies: 

- NodeJS,
- Express,
- Html,
- Bootstrap,
- Mongodb,
- Cheerio,
- Javascript, 
- JQuery,
- NPM,
- Morgan,
- Mongoose.

Moving forward, we want to incorporate the following technologies: 

- Handlebars (to render server contents),
- Bcrypt (to enable user log in).

## Future Plans 

Apart from using Handlebars to deliver server contents and Bcrypt for user registration, we want to improve the application by adding more global / popular news websites to scrape news from. 
This will allow users to not only get stories from the famous New York Times but also to get more news and insights from other websites such as Al Jazeera, The economists, USA Today, etc...
